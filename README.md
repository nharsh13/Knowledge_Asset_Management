# Knowledge_Asset_Management

Knowledge Asset Management serves as a digital platform, facilitating teams or groups of users to seamlessly upload and access data in the format of document.
This portal offers a dual-tiered login interface encompassing individual user access followed by admin access.
Regarding user privileges, the system comes with the functionality for uploading assets, alongside the capability for users to access and download assets contributed by fellow team constituents.
Talking about the admin privilege, the admin login comes with interface where the admin can create a user ID for accessing the asset management portal. Also a special feature is added in the admin login interface where the admin can delete the documents according to their convenience.

This is a live project which I have made during my internship tenure at Tata Technologies. This portal is being used by 50+ employees smoothening their work functionality.
